/**
 * One place that decides how a person's name is written on screen.
 *
 * The rule, from the brief: never blank, never "Unnamed", and never
 * an email address standing in for a name. Those all leak database
 * state into the interface — an email in place of a name tells the
 * reader something has gone wrong without telling them what.
 *
 * Names are required when a login is created and backfilled for every
 * existing account (0022), so the fallback here should never actually
 * be reached. It exists because a page crashing — or printing
 * "undefined" — is a far worse failure than printing a neutral
 * placeholder, and this is the single place that decision is made.
