/**
 * The nav's icon set.
 *
 * Drawn rather than borrowed, and drawn to one spec so the row reads as
 * a set instead of a ransom note: a 24-unit box, no fill, 1.6 stroke in
 * `currentColor`, round caps and joins, shapes built from straight runs
 * and single-radius corners.
 *
 * That spec is not arbitrary — it is what the icons already in this app
 * use (the notification bell, the burger, the visibility eye in Work
 * Chat), so these sit beside them without looking imported. Inheriting
 * `currentColor` matters too: it means an icon dims and brightens with
 * its label as the active state changes, rather than staying a fixed
 * grey while the text moves.
 *
 * Deliberately not emoji. Emoji render in each platform's own house
 * style — full colour, rounded, Apple's or Google's rather than ours —
 * and would be the one thing in the chrome that belongs to somebody
 * else's brand.
